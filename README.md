# NFS Most Wanted - Joylog Control Plugin

This is a dedicated plugin that can control Joylog operations in NFS Most Wanted.

It's an excerpt of my other project, [XNFS-SkipFE](https://github.com/xan1242/xnfs-skipfe) but with cut out SkipFE functionality. 

I've also updated the code with pattern detects and better function call conventions, as well as detecting if a console window is present before printing any messages.
